Balatro MCP pairs a TypeScript MCP server with a Steamodded/Lovely Balatro mod so agents can inspect live game state and interact with Balatro through a fully textual interface. No vision model or screen scraping is required.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is currently configured and tested for macOS Apple Silicon. Universal setup support is planned for a future release.

## What It Provides

- **Live game observations** through `balatro_inspect_game_state`, including phase, hand, jokers, shop, blind, deck summary, legal actions, and rules metadata.
- **Typed game actions** for blinds, hand selection, play/discard, buying, boosters, shop flow, consumables, selling, and Joker reordering.
- **Text-first agent control** so models can reason over structured state instead of relying on screenshots.
- **Game knowledge surfaces** including a rules resource, strategy prompt, and entity references.

## Architecture

    a socket or HTTP server is considered for
    performance and reliability in the future.

## Requirements

- Balatro installed through Steam.
- [Lovely Injector](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector).
- [Steamodded / SMODS](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods).
- Node.js 18 or newer.
- pnpm.
- Lua tooling with `luac` available for syntax checks.

## Quick Start

Build the MCP server, install or reload the companion Balatro mod with your local Lovely/SMODS workflow, then configure your MCP client to launch the built server entrypoint.

## Using the MCP Server

The server exposes tools with the `balatro_` prefix, including:

| Area      | Tools                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| State     | `balatro_inspect_game_state`                                                                                    |
| Blinds    | `balatro_select_blind`, `balatro_skip_blind`                                                                    |
| Hand play | `balatro_select_hand_cards`, `balatro_sort_hand`, `balatro_play_hand`, `balatro_discard_hand`                   |
| Shop      | `balatro_buy_card`, `balatro_buy_and_use_card`, `balatro_reroll_shop`, `balatro_leave_shop`, `balatro_cash_out` |
| Cards     | `balatro_use_consumable`, `balatro_sell_card`, `balatro_reorder_jokers`                                         |
| Boosters  | `balatro_open_booster`, `balatro_select_booster_card`, `balatro_skip_booster`                                   |
| Knowledge | `balatro_list_game_entities`, `balatro_get_game_entity`                                                         |

It also registers:

- `balatro://rules/global` as a static rules resource.
- `balatro_strategy_context` as a strategy prompt for agents.

## Validation

When changing the MCP server or companion mod, run the relevant TypeScript and Lua checks for your checkout. After changing the Balatro mod, reload Balatro and verify the behavior through the MCP tools rather than only reading the code.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP tools report `GAME_NOT_RUNNING`

Make sure Balatro is running with the companion mod loaded, then confirm the MCP client is launching the built server successfully.

### Balatro does not reflect a mod change

Reload or restart Balatro after updating the installed companion mod. Lua files are loaded by the game runtime, not by the MCP server process.

### The MCP server cannot start

Build the MCP server before launching it. If your client launches a stale build, rebuild and restart the MCP session.
